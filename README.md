# dayplanner

https://sanawck.github.io/dayplanner/.

this homework was to create a dayplanner. i worked with my TA and additional tutoring sessions to complete this. This project is intended to help create a organized list of daily tasks. It updates the time and indicates past, present and future time blocks. It saves tasks to local storage. I used the starter code provided which had bootstrap and jquery librarys. I plan to update the style element of this in the future to make it look more appealing.

The below are the requirements to be met

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
